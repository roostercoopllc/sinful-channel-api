## Inspiration
Taken straight from our script, but nonetheless the heart of our integration, we wanted to consider some of that feeling of playing video games with your friends, having that one friend that was just too good, and making it a point to find some way to make them win less often...or at least not as well as they usually do. That being said, we wanted to give users and streamers the feeling of messing with or having your controller messed with or even you perspective distorted. 

## What it does
In the current build, the integration allows viewers to redeem channel points to enact either a screen flip/rotation, a reorganization of keys (AWSD keybindings are jumbled amongst themselves), or both. By adding the Python (version 3.6 is required) script, streamers will have the ability to control the duration of the screen flip/rotation or key reorganization.

Looking to future features, this integration might include the ability to change the streamer's display to be gray scale, boost the in-game brightness to 100%, or even mute the streamer's microphone for a fixed period of time. Additionally, there are considerations for how this might integrate with system or room RGB fixtures (allowing viewers to momentarily change the color(s) of the RGB fixtures), or build hooks into a game's difficulty settings (allowing viewers to briefly control the difficulty setting of the current game (assuming a difficulty slider exists)).

Perhaps a function could be added such that viewers could work together to block streamer's abilities. But, this comes with a cost - it's a gamble for your points every time! Or finally, a feature could be added to reduce all redemption costs and cooldowns, allowing viewers to go wild making streamers' experiences extremely difficult.
