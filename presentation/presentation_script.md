Remember playing video games with your friends and having that one friend that was just too good?! At some point, most of you probably tried to find some way to beat 
them that didn't involve pure game skill. Maybe you decided to mess with their controller (even unplug it maybe?), or stepped in front of their side of the TV or 
some way to finally get a competitive advantage...even for a minute or two?

Now, watching your favorite streamers on Twitch, perhaps you have a similar desire to sow some chaos? With this Twitch Channel Point integration, you will be able to add
some difficulty for your favorite streamers, similar to that experience with your friend when you were kids. Think of a First Person Shooter, for instance...a game type
that requires you to see your targets and also move correctly to come out the Champion at the end of the round. So...what if you had the opportunity then to...flip 
the screen, or maybe even change the orientation of their movement keys, so that what was once up is now down, left is now right...and basically just create chaos?? 

Well, worry not my friends, this Twitch Channel Point integration gives you the ability to do just that. Just by redeeming those hard earned channel points, you can flip
the screen for your streamer, and make it so that…OH COME ON…THE FLOOR IS THE CEILING?! REALLY?....for a little while at least. 

If that’s not really your speed, maybe you want to change their movement keys to be backwards…switched…just confusing. There’s nothing more frustrating than suddenly 
walking yourself off of a cliff because you tried to back up…only to find that your keys are now flipped. Wrong way pal!

But if you feel like that was all child’s play, and you want to make streaming a momentary nightmare, look no further! With Total Chaos mode you can do both at the same 
time! The screen is flipped, the keys are all wrong, and nothing makes sense for a bit. Good luck surviving that, streamers! 

So…remembering that experience growing up and trying to find a way to make your good gamer friends less so…just for a moment, think of this Channel Point integration as 
your ability to do all of that. This integration will give you that control and allow you to feel the power of chaos.

Not to worry though…this level of chaos is only experienced by the streamer, while channel points are being redeemed. This integration was configured to operate in both Windows and MacOS environments, it works in conjunction with the most current version of OBS, and requires minimal configuration using a Python script on Python version 3.6.
